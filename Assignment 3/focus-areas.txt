When designing the project, I wanted to program the video to a certain short portion of the song: Home - Were finally landing. I chose to start the initial zoom into the set when the beat dropped in the song. From there, everything is timed to be coinciding with the music. Every time a synth is heard, it  is accompanied by a new focus point of my video.

We begin by zooming into what I call the Chidori point (because the geometry and colour look like lightning) when the beat drops. I chose to start here because the specifically chosen pathway to the next point overviews the edge of the main bulb of the Mandelbrot set. The next zoom point is a non-branch Misiurewicz point, once again coinciding with a synth sound.

From there, I chose to go from the pleasing light blue point to a contrastingly chaotic dark red abyss, which I promptly named: "The Depths of Tartarus". From there we reach our final infinitesimal destination, a Principal Misiurewicz point. You'll notice the drums in the music drop and the becomes melancholic, and were left slowly zooming into the point as we cut to black.


The pixelation of the frames is due to the fixed depth value. To counter this problem I modifie
